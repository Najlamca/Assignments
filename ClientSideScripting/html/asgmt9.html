 <a id=1><h3>Computer</h3></a><br>
 	<a href="#top">Go to top</a>
 	<p>A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow generalized sequences of operations, called programs, enable them to perform a wide range of tasks.</p>

<a id=2><h4>Central processing unit (CPU)</h4></a><br>
 	<a href="#top">Go to top</a>
	<p> Central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.</p>

<a id=3><h4>ALU</h4></a><br>
	 <a href="#top">Go to top</a>
	<p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). A single CPU, FPU or GPU may contain multiple ALUs.</p>

<a id=4><h3>Operating system</h3></a><br>
 	<a href="#top">Go to top</a>
	<p>An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function.Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.</p>

<a id=5><h4>Microsoft Windows</h4></a><br>
 	<a href="#top">Go to top</a>
	<p>Microsoft Windows, or simply Windows, is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture.</p>

<a id=6><h4>Linux</h4></a><br>
 	<a href="#top">Go to top</a>
	<p>Linux is a Unix-like computer operating system assembled under the model of free and open-source software development and distribution. The defining component of Linux is the Linux kernel,an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991 by Linus Torvalds.Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system.</p>

<a id=7><h3>Programming Language</h3></a><br>
 	<a href="#top">Go to top</a>
	<p>A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>

<a id=8><h4>C</h4></a><br>
 	<a href="#top">Go to top</a>
	<p>C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p>

<a id=9><h4>C++</h4></a><br>
 	<a href="#top">Go to top</a>
	<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.</p>
